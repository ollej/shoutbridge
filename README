Shoutbridge

UBB.threads Shoubox <-> XMPP Bridge

Description:
A bridge software that allows discussions in a UBB.threads shoutbox to be mirrored to an XMPP chat.


Requirements:
 * Python 2.6
 * MySQL
 * UBB.threads v7
 * Twisted
 * MySQLdb


Installation:
 $ sudo easy_install MySQLdb
 $ sudo easy_install Twisted
 $ cp config-example.ini config.ini

Edit the config.ini file and change the values to something appropriate.
The db_* values should be set to your UBB.threads installation.
xmpp_login and xmpp_pass should be set to an xmpp account that will be used to relay
messages between the shoutbox and the chat room. You have to register this account
yourself.
xmpp_room should be the full jid to the chat room to connect to. This should
already be created, as Shoutbridge currently can't create it.
xmpp_host and xmpp_port should be set to the jabber server to connect to.

In UBB.threads, you should set Profile Extra Field 1 to "JID Login". If a user 
enters their jabber id in this field, messages sent from that jid will be written
as that user in the shoutbox.

Now you should be ready to start the program:
 $ python shoutbridge.py


Main features:
 * All messages written in Shoutbox should be sent to the XMPP chat room.
 * All messages written in the XMPP chat room should be sent to the Shoutbox.
 * If no XMPP details, messages will be sent with UBB.threads username prepended to message.
 * Messages from XMPP will be added as user in Shoutbox if they have XMPP login details saved in profile.
 * Simple API to UBB.threads to read/write messages and get user by login details and login details from user.
 * Keep track of roster via prescence, read user info only once.
 * Connect to an xmpp conference room instead of just sending messages to a user
 

TODO:
 * If UBB.threads user has XMPP login details saved, messages should be sent using these.
 * Move date formats into configuration.
 * Send config object as parameter to Shoutbox/XmppBridge instead of values.
 * Possibly change to a transport gateway using XEP-0100: Gateway Interaction
 * Plugins for message hooks, to allow simple bot-like behavior.
 * Dice Bot which can roll dice, e.g. "/dice 3d6" gives "Dice roll result: 12 (5 + 3 + 4)"
 * /me 
 * When time is the same as the current time, don't prepend time to message.
