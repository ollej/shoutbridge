Do you know what would be the best way to wipe out all of human kind if you were a space alien with a special kind of mind ray...? Make all women telepathic. Because if they suddenly found out about the kind of stuff that goes on in our heads they would kill us all on the spot. Men are not people - we are disgustoids in human form.

You can't say 'hippo'. You don't want to come off sounding like some surreal, cupboard-loitering lunatic.

That's not the point. The point is the new and terrifying location of my arse.
%
It's an arse nightmare. An arsemare.

There I am, innocently trying to free my head from a photocopier and my arse is wiggling about like an arse-maniac, like an arse of insanity in the mind of a madman.

Well, it's kind of hard to tell isn't it 'cos you tend to fast forward if anyone's dressed. Sometimes I forget and do that with proper films. I can get through a lot of movies in an evening.

It's not Steve's fault. You can't blame Steve. It's the cupboards fault. There's too much nudity in the cupboard.

We can't help ourselves. We hone in, we're drawn, like perverted moths'.

I've got the key to the gates of paradise; but I've got too many legs!
