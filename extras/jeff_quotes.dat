I think breast brains would be over-egging the woman pudding. Besides, you give breasts the power of independent thought and the next thing that happens they don't get on.
%
Do you know what would be the best way to wipe out all of human kind if you were a space alien with a special kind of mind ray...? Make all women telepathic. Because if they suddenly found out about the kind of stuff that goes on in our heads they would kill us all on the spot. Men are not people - we are disgustoids in human form. 
%
She's leaving the country... she doesn't speak English... I insulted her friend's breasts... and she thinks I collect women's ears in a bucket. 
%
You know what, there's something I've always wanted to say and, erm, now I feel that at long last I can. Breasts. Breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts! 
%
I've got all that disgustoid stuff in my head now, what if I say gusset accidentally? 
%
Yeah, the pause is like a whole third person in the conversation, only not saying much... like Patrick. 
%
My advice is to get them off right after your shoes and before your trousers... that's the sock gap. Miss it and suddenly you're a naked man in socks. No self-respecting woman with let a naked man in socks do the squelchy with her.
%
Many men have fallen through the sock gap Patrick. Under the sexual arena of earthly delight, there lurks a deadly pit of socks.
%
It must be alot easier being gay. Sex must be a piece of piss if you're gay.
%
If you're gay, masturbation is practice! You can have a good old practice on you own, and when you're ready, when you got the hang of it, you have a go on someone else's.
%
When we finally get our hands on the gear, let me tell you, it's not a drill. We're supposed to fly those babies the first time we get in them.
%
You can't say 'hippo'. You don't want to come off sounding like some surreal, cupboard-loitering lunatic.
%
That's not the point. The point is the new and terrifying location of my arse.
%
It's an arse nightmare. An arsemare.
%
There I am, innocently trying to free my head from a photocopier and my arse is wiggling about like an arse-maniac, like an arse of insanity in the mind of a madman.
%
Sex can be very stressful for men. You judge us on technique, sensitivity, stamina... We're just happy if you're naked... half naked... one breast.
%
The Zone has a new king!
%
Well, it's kind of hard to tell isn't it 'cos you tend to fast forward if anyone's dressed. Sometimes I forget and do that with proper films. I can get through a lot of movies in an evening.
%
It's not Steve's fault. You can't blame Steve. It's the cupboards fault. There's too much nudity in the cupboard.
%
We can't help ourselves. We hone in, we're drawn, like perverted moths'.
%
I've got the key to the gates of paradise; but I've got too many legs!
%
Women remember, Steve. It's like they have minds of their own.
%
She thinks I'm a mute with a balance problem.
%
To know of the giggle loop, is to become part of the giggle loop!
%
I get very tense around apples... Well, I get very tense generally. I think I’ve fallen into the trap of blaming fruit.
%
I need breasts with brains. I don’t mean individual brains, obviously...
%
When God made the arse, he didn't say, 'Hey, it's just your basic hinge, let's knock off early.' He said, 'Behold ye angels, I have created the arse. Throughout the ages to come, men and women shall grab hold of these, and shout my name!
%
She's leaving the country, doesn't speak English, I insulted her friend's breasts and she thinks I collect women's ears in a bucket.
%
I love the word naked, it's brilliant isn't it, 'naked'. When I was a kid I used to write the word naked on a bit of paper hundreds of times and rub my face in it. 
%
I am a prison for sperms. Those poor little tadpoles have been sentenced to life in Jeff Murdock's groin. And let me tell you, that can be a pretty lonely place.
%
But that's not what the boys are wanting, is it? See, they want to think they're going somewhere when they go. I keep thinking about my brave lads all excited on the launch pad, and then suddenly it's "Uhh, no! Daylight!"
%
You know what having a girlfriend is like? Having a girlfriend is like legalised sex.
%
I'm not bad. I've never been bad... I'm fairly new to mild naughtiness.
%
Oh, oh yeah she exists. She's very much an existing person, she's got tons of existence. [beat] Well not too much existence, I don't mean she's huge or anything. She's somewhere between completely imaginary and a truck. If you can picture that.
%
You know jelly-wrestling... which is basically jelly with women wrestling in it... OK, well, think about this. Afterwards, after the wrestling, what happens to the jelly? Because you could sell that. That is a missed opportunity. You could bottle it and sell it... You take the women out first, obviously.
%
Being a lesbian. All the advantages of being a man but with less embarrassing genitals. Plus, every time you have sex, there's four breasts! Two guest breasts and two you can take home afterwards, oh, it's bloody brilliant!
%
This is like Captain Problem. This is like "Houston, forget that other thing".
%
Sex.... It's just like cuddling - only damper.
%
There's a supermodel who shags total prats and I don't know where she lives... 
%
Maybe women are completely different when we're not with them. Maybe they're not cross all the time. 
%
Whenever I have sex with Julia, it’s just so realistic.
%
Yeah, especially the tongues part. I love getting all that extra tongue. You know, sometimes I eat really cold ice cream so my tongue goes numb and it feels like someone elses... don’t we all get lonely sometimes.
%
Stockings are real. I've seen 'em.
%
Should you be making noises yet? Is it too soon to grunt?
%
This is the worst one ever! I can't even talk about it!
%
I was seven. I didn't realize television could do that! I started watching it all day every day, just in case it did it again.
%
My parents thought that I was in love with the TV set. 
%
But also I'd get aroused the moment it was switched on, you know, even if it was just the news or Doctor Who.
%
One day... one day I lost control in front of my whole family during Songs of Praise.
%
Breasts!
%
I see women as people in their own right.
%
Hey, I can see past breasts now, Steve. I need more than that.
%
You know what, there's something I've always wanted to say and, erm, now I feel that at long last I can. Breasts. Breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts!
%
I've got all that disgustoid stuff in my head now, what if I say gusset accidentally?
%
Alright, when you first see a woman you like you have a buffer of about five minutes before you have fully mapped out what she looks like naked.
%
You have to asses her nipple type and that takes time.
%
Yeah, but we're all the same as Patrick. See, women think we're normal, like them, 'cause we talk to them like normal people, you know, we say, "hello, how are you. Haven't seen you in this place before. What kind of music do you like?" But all the time in our brains, we've got the word "breasts" on a loop. If we ever lost control for a second, we'd all start shouting "Breasts! Breasts! Breasts! Breasts!"
%
That redhead has been naked in my head for two years now, performing *deviant* sex acts that would make the world's top porn stars go white and steady themselves on the furniture. I lose the ability to speak the moment she comes into the room. Every time she passes me in a corridor, I walk sideways into the wall. She thinks I'm a mute with a balance problem.
%
If you fantasize about someone else during sex, and so does your partner, and, you know, those two people that you're fantasizing about happen to meet while you're still doing it, they're bound to sense something, aren't they? Because they're connecting on, like, a virtual plane. So can you imagine what it was like when Posh first met Beckham? They were the epicenter of a non-stop, nationwide virtual shag!
%
In the event of Steve's death, the first thing I will do, upset though I will be, is go straight to his house and remove all the pornography before his parents can find it. And he's pledged to do the same for me. That's how close we are!
%
That's the beauty of it, you see? Your best friend's dead, but there's a bright side!
%
All of us, in our time, are visited by the melty man.
%
You're in bed with a woman. Everything's going fine. That's when the melty man strikes.
%
Maybe you're licking her neck too much. Are you over-wetting her neck?
%
Should you be switching between them really quickly or should you squish 'em both together and do them at once?
%
She's wriggling about. Is that a good sign or is she just trying to dry her neck?
%
OK on the breast thing. I'll go in exchange for a breast!
%
Yeah, during a panic attack, I was blind!
%
OK, have you thought through your foreplay yet?
%
Only an interview! Only an interview!... What if I panic? You know… What if I say an accidental word?
%
Because I've just put the idea in my head, haven't I? Now I've got a flashing sign in my brain saying "Nipples! Nipples! Nipples!"
%
Well, you're perfect practice for me, I've seen you naked. I've got something to base it on.
%
Aaah... you can read. I mean you are reading. Sorry!
%
It's nice to see people reading. Not a lot of people read these days. People prefer to... hear. But all this hearing is just reading for lazy people.
%
Kids today should be prepared to pick up a book and not go around the whole time with these... modern... ears.
%
Sometimes I just want to rip people's ears off and say: "Read a book, for god's sake!" Well, actually I'd probably say 'read a book' first and then rip their ears off, otherwise they wouldn't hear me.
%
Actually I probably wouldn't rip their ears off at all, I'm not a violent person.
%
I like ears. Especially women ears, they're my favourite! I don't mean I collect them, or anything, I don't have a big bucket of women-ears hidden away somewhere. No-no-no!
%
I'm not after your ears, really! Not that there's anything wrong with your ears. If I was some kind of mad ear person your ears would be the pride of my ... ear bucket. Oh my god!
%
I don't know what the hell you just said but can I say - bra.
%
This makes life so much easier! Thighs! Tights! 
%
I don't know what this is about but it's brilliant!
%
Sorry, I was expecting Shadaym!
%
So, if you built your new supermodel, or your new Helen Mirren, out of all best bits then why? why did Claudia Schiffer shag David Copperfield?!?!? 
%
Because... she's just so naked, isn't she?
%
It's like she's just got to get her clothes off. It's like her breasts are afraid of the dark.
%
When a Helen Mirren film comes on a telly that's like a guarantee. Her name says: OK, boys, you better watch this one with a curtain shut!
%
You've had more than one come-on? Well, that's brilliant!
%
Do you know what she's like? It's as if you took Naomi Campbell and Jenny Agutter and mixed them up in a big bowl with Davina McCall's bottom. Is it any wonder I love her?
%
Ha-ha! But I haven't seen Davina McCall's bottom either! I added Davina's bottom to the Campbell-Agutter mix to lend an air of enigma.
%
You look just like the back of your head.
%
But the front's just as good. Better in fact, because... you've got a face! And I'm not just saying that.
%
I'm just saying it's great to see your legs together for once!
%
What I meant... normally I enjoy your legs separately. 
%
Believe me, I'm not trying to part your legs...
%
I'm not one of these amputators.
%
It's perfect, isn't it? This is the curse of Jeff Murdoch! I meet the woman of my dreams and I can't take my trousers off.
%
But what about my legs? You know, she's bound to count them eventually!
%
I can't believe they put stuff like that on television.
%
If he ever meets Mariella Frostrup in person his right hand will shout: "Mother!"
%
You're shaking the caravan, Jeffrey!
%
Oh yeah, sure! Yeah! It's like when you're sitting on a bus and there's this woman. That's the worst!
%
Or your mother starts making enormous sculptures of erections and filling the house with them. That's what I hate!
%
I nearly had an opinion about that one.
%
Sally is Susan's best friend, she's completely off limits. You have seen into the very heart of the forbidden lands. You must never speak of what you saw.
%
Best friends and sisters. You can talk to them, you can be friends with them but you never get a backstage pass.
%
Do you know what Captain Subtext would say?
%
Captain Subtext isn't a real person, Steve.
%
And he didn't have a cave. He lived in our attic and had secret meetings with my mother.
%
He had a special helmet of truth detection. And if I ever told any lies, he'd sneak into my room when I was asleep and perform surgical operations on me.
%
Every morning I'd check and my penis would be a tiny bit smaller. Every time I told a lie he'd sneak in and remove another segment.
%
That's how my mother would know if I'd been fibbing. "Keep up with all your lying, Jeffrey, I've always wanted a daughter!" Aah, mothers, heh?
%
You don't understand. I can't look at her without imagining her ass now. It's transmitting. I look at her face and get ass.
%
I know, I know, but it's out there now. You released it, Steve! Sally's ass has tasted freedom and it's never going back.
%
Buttocks! Gusset! Bicycle saddle!
%
Yeah, and there’s always these puppies up in a car you’ve got to rescue!
%
Brilliant!
%
You’re weird! You’re weird, you are!
