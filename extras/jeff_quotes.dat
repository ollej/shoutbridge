I think breast brains would be over-egging the woman pudding. Besides, you give breasts the power of independent thought and the next thing that happens they don't get on.
%
Do you know what would be the best way to wipe out all of human kind if you were a space alien with a special kind of mind ray...? Make all women telepathic. Because if they suddenly found out about the kind of stuff that goes on in our heads they would kill us all on the spot. Men are not people - we are disgustoids in human form. 
%
She's leaving the country... she doesn't speak English... I insulted her friend's breasts... and she thinks I collect women's ears in a bucket. 
%
You know what, there's something I've always wanted to say and, erm, now I feel that at long last I can. Breasts. Breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts! 
%
I've got all that disgustoid stuff in my head now, what if I say gusset accidentally? 
%
Yeah, the pause is like a whole third person in the conversation, only not saying much... like Patrick. 
%
My advice is to get them off right after your shoes and before your trousers... that's the sock gap. Miss it and suddenly you're a naked man in socks. No self-respecting woman with let a naked man in socks do the squelchy with her.
%
Many men have fallen through the sock gap Patrick. Under the sexual arena of earthly delight, there lurks a deadly pit of socks.
%
It must be alot easier being gay. Sex must be a piece of piss if you're gay.
%
If you're gay, masturbation is practice! You can have a good old practice on you own, and when you're ready, when you got the hang of it, you have a go on someone else's.
%
When we finally get our hands on the gear, let me tell you, it's not a drill. We're supposed to fly those babies the first time we get in them.
%
You can't say 'hippo'. You don't want to come off sounding like some surreal, cupboard-loitering lunatic.
%
That's not the point. The point is the new and terrifying location of my arse.
%
It's an arse nightmare. An arsemare.
%
There I am, innocently trying to free my head from a photocopier and my arse is wiggling about like an arse-maniac, like an arse of insanity in the mind of a madman.
%
Sex can be very stressful for men. You judge us on technique, sensitivity, stamina... We're just happy if you're naked... half naked... one breast.
%
The Zone has a new king!
%
Well, it's kind of hard to tell isn't it 'cos you tend to fast forward if anyone's dressed. Sometimes I forget and do that with proper films. I can get through a lot of movies in an evening.
%
It's not Steve's fault. You can't blame Steve. It's the cupboards fault. There's too much nudity in the cupboard.
%
We can't help ourselves. We hone in, we're drawn, like perverted moths'.
%
I've got the key to the gates of paradise; but I've got too many legs!
%
Women remember, Steve. It's like they have minds of their own.
%
She thinks I'm a mute with a balance problem.
%
To know of the giggle loop, is to become part of the giggle loop!
%
I get very tense around apples... Well, I get very tense generally. I think I’ve fallen into the trap of blaming fruit.
%
I need breasts with brains. I don’t mean individual brains, obviously...
%
When God made the arse, he didn't say, 'Hey, it's just your basic hinge, let's knock off early.' He said, 'Behold ye angels, I have created the arse. Throughout the ages to come, men and women shall grab hold of these, and shout my name!
%
She's leaving the country, doesn't speak English, I insulted her friend's breasts and she thinks I collect women's ears in a bucket.
%
I love the word naked, it's brilliant isn't it, 'naked'. When I was a kid I used to write the word naked on a bit of paper hundreds of times and rub my face in it. 
%
I am a prison for sperms. Those poor little tadpoles have been sentenced to life in Jeff Murdock's groin. And let me tell you, that can be a pretty lonely place.
%
But that's not what the boys are wanting, is it? See, they want to think they're going somewhere when they go. I keep thinking about my brave lads all excited on the launch pad, and then suddenly it's "Uhh, no! Daylight!"
%
You know what having a girlfriend is like? Having a girlfriend is like legalised sex.
%
I'm not bad. I've never been bad... I'm fairly new to mild naughtiness.
%
Oh, oh yeah she exists. She's very much an existing person, she's got tons of existence. [beat] Well not too much existence, I don't mean she's huge or anything. She's somewhere between completely imaginary and a truck. If you can picture that.
%
You know jelly-wrestling... which is basically jelly with women wrestling in it... OK, well, think about this. Afterwards, after the wrestling, what happens to the jelly? Because you could sell that. That is a missed opportunity. You could bottle it and sell it... You take the women out first, obviously.
%
Being a lesbian. All the advantages of being a man but with less embarrassing genitals. Plus, every time you have sex, there's four breasts! Two guest breasts and two you can take home afterwards, oh, it's bloody brilliant!
%
This is like Captain Problem. This is like "Houston, forget that other thing".
%
Sex.... It's just like cuddling - only damper.
%
There's a supermodel who shags total prats and I don't know where she lives... 
%
Maybe women are completely different when we're not with them. Maybe they're not cross all the time. 
%
Whenever I have sex with Julia, it’s just so realistic.
%
Yeah, especially the tongues part. I love getting all that extra tongue. You know, sometimes I eat really cold ice cream so my tongue goes numb and it feels like someone elses... don’t we all get lonely sometimes.
%
Stockings are real. I've seen 'em.
%
Should you be making noises yet? Is it too soon to grunt?
%
This is the worst one ever! I can't even talk about it!
%
I was seven. I didn't realize television could do that! I started watching it all day every day, just in case it did it again.
%
Breasts!
%
I see women as people in their own right.
%
Hey, I can see past breasts now, Steve. I need more than that.
%
You know what, there's something I've always wanted to say and, erm, now I feel that at long last I can. Breasts. Breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts, breasts!
%
I've got all that disgustoid stuff in my head now, what if I say gusset accidentally?
%
Alright, when you first see a woman you like you have a buffer of about five minutes before you have fully mapped out what she looks like naked.
%
You have to asses her nipple type and that takes time.
%
Yeah, but we're all the same as Patrick. See, women think we're normal, like them, 'cause we talk to them like normal people, you know, we say, "hello, how are you. Haven't seen you in this place before. What kind of music do you like?" But all the time in our brains, we've got the word "breasts" on a loop. If we ever lost control for a second, we'd all start shouting "Breasts! Breasts! Breasts! Breasts!"
%
That redhead has been naked in my head for two years now, performing *deviant* sex acts that would make the world's top porn stars go white and steady themselves on the furniture. I lose the ability to speak the moment she comes into the room. Every time she passes me in a corridor, I walk sideways into the wall. She thinks I'm a mute with a balance problem.
%
If you fantasize about someone else during sex, and so does your partner, and, you know, those two people that you're fantasizing about happen to meet while you're still doing it, they're bound to sense something, aren't they? Because they're connecting on, like, a virtual plane. So can you imagine what it was like when Posh first met Beckham? They were the epicenter of a non-stop, nationwide virtual shag!
%
In the event of Steve's death, the first thing I will do, upset though I will be, is go straight to his house and remove all the pornography before his parents can find it. And he's pledged to do the same for me. That's how close we are!
%
That's the beauty of it, you see? Your best friend's dead, but there's a bright side!
%
All of us, in our time, are visited by the melty man.
%
You're in bed with a woman. Everything's going fine. That's when the melty man strikes.
%
Maybe you're licking her neck too much. Are you over-wetting her neck?
%
Should you be switching between them really quickly or should you squish 'em both together and do them at once?
%
She's wriggling about. Is that a good sign or is she just trying to dry her neck?
